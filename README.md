# Snappy
Snappy Instant Messenger

I started this new project based on spika messenger (https://github.com/cloverstudio/Spika) because they are not supporting the opensource community.

If u want to join this project and give some help, please contact me


Current Mayor Bugs (I'm working....)
  * Push notifications are not working
  * Google maps not loading (error getting location)

Bugs fixed
  * Repeated controls ID's in some activities
  * Emoticons not loading, apache throws some errors
  * Added new instructions for backend setup
  
Currently im focused on make android application works, so please be patient with IOS Application and Client (web) application
because i'm doing this in my free time.

If u want to support me to continue working on this project, make me a donation (paypal)
